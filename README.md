# First React Project => Gallivant

To gallivant, or go gallivanting, means to wander from place to place seeking pleasure and amusement – so definitely not to be used when you’re going on a boring business trip. Its first known use dates back to 1823, and originally it mean to go about indiscreetly with members of the opposite sex – essentially being free and easy with your time. Its original meaning is thought to come from the word gallant, a word used to describe a man who is charmingly attentive and chivalrous to women. Along the way its meaning has softened, and it’s used to describe anyone who’s travelling in search of fun – “He’s been gallivanting all over the country instead of looking for a job.”

A travel inspired site. It's static in design, but will update features whenever I learn new stuff that can be implemented (i.e. google authentication)
